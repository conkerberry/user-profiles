This is a simple website that uses HTML/CSS and JavaScript to Create, Updated and Delete profiles. 
The header contains a button to switch to dark mode at the left side and an option to add new profiles on the right. 
ADDING PROFILES: Once this button is clicked, it opens a form which collects the user data required to create a new profile (name, contact number, email address, profile picture, bio, address). 
VIEWEING PROFILES: Simply click on a profile to display the user details.
UPDATE PROFILES: Hovering over the user profiles will show us the edit option, which on clicking will allow us to edit the user information.
DELETE PROFILES: The delete option also appears when the cursor hovers over a profile and clicking on it will remove the user profile.
